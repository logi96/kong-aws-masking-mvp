## 3. Gaps to Reach 80% Coverage

### Critical Gaps
1. **AWS Service** (47.5% → 80%)
   - Missing: Error path testing in executeAwsCommand
   - Missing: All fetch methods (fetchLambdaResources, fetchIAMResources, etc.)
   - Missing: Edge cases in response parsing

2. **Claude Service** (53.22% → 80%)
   - Missing: buildAnalysisPrompt method tests
   - Missing: formatAnalysisResponse tests
   - Missing: Retry logic testing

3. **Redis Service** (42.55% → 80%)
   - Missing: Batch operations
   - Missing: Transaction operations
   - Missing: Scan operations
   - Missing: Error recovery scenarios

### Low Priority Gaps
- Health Check Service (11.88%)
- Monitoring Service (13.63%)

## 4. Recommendations to Reach 80% Coverage

### Phase 1: Critical Service Coverage (Est. 2-3 days)
1. **Enhance AWS Service Tests**
   - Add mocks for all AWS resource types
   - Test error conditions thoroughly
   - Add integration scenarios

2. **Complete Claude Service Tests**
   - Mock all Claude API responses
   - Test all analysis types
   - Add timeout and retry tests

3. **Expand Redis Service Tests**
   - Test all Redis operations
   - Add connection failure scenarios
   - Test batch and transaction operations

### Phase 2: Integration Tests (Est. 1-2 days)
1. **End-to-End Flow Tests**
   - AWS fetch → Kong masking → Claude analysis → Unmask
   - Error propagation tests
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Kong Plugin Integration**
   - Test with actual Kong runtime
   - Load testing with concurrent requests
   - Memory leak detection

### Phase 3: Optional Enhancements (Est. 1 day)
1. **Monitoring Service Tests**
   - Metric collection tests
   - Alert threshold tests

2. **Health Check Service Tests**
   - Dependency check tests
   - Circuit breaker tests

## 5. Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Backend unit tests with coverage
cd backend
npm run test:coverage

# Kong plugin tests (requires busted)
cd kong/plugins/aws-masker
busted -c

# Integration tests
cd tests
./comprehensive-flow-test.sh
./comprehensive-security-test.sh

# Generate HTML coverage report
npm run test:coverage -- --coverageReporters=html
open coverage/index.html
```

## 6. Conclusion

### Achievements
- ✅ Improved coverage from 29.78% to 47.26%
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suites for all major components
- ✅ Established testing patterns for both Node.js and Lua
- ✅ Documented all test cases and coverage gaps

### Next Steps
To reach the 80% coverage target:
1. Focus on AWS and Claude service test completion
2. Enhance Redis service test coverage
3. Add integration test suite
4. Consider using test coverage tools like `nyc` for better reporting

### Estimated Effort
- **To reach 60%**: 1 day (focus on critical services)
- **To reach 70%**: 2-3 days (add integration tests)
- **To reach 80%**: 4-5 days (complete all recommendations)
