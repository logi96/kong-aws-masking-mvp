```bash
# Collect all metrics
./scripts/day4-advanced-metrics.sh collect

# Individual metric types
./scripts/day4-advanced-metrics.sh aws-masking

**Alert Rules:**
- AWS masking failure rate > 10%
- P95 response time > 5000ms
- P99 response time > 10000ms
- Redis memory > 100MB
- Kong plugin disabled
- System CPU/Memory > 80%

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start alerting daemon
./scripts/day4-alerting-system.sh start

# Manual alert check
./scripts/day4-alerting-system.sh check

# View alert history
./scripts/day4-alerting-system.sh history
```

### 3. Log Aggregation & Analysis System (`day4-log-aggregation.sh`)

**Purpose:** Aggregate, analyze, and classify logs from all system components

**Features:**
- **Multi-source Aggregation:** Kong, Nginx, Backend, Monitoring logs
- **Error Classification:** 10+ error pattern recognition
- **Trend Analysis:** 24-hour performance trends
- **Automated Reports:** JSON and text-based summaries

**Log Sources:**
- Kong access/error logs
- Nginx access/error logs  
- Backend application logs
- Health/system monitoring logs

**Usage:**
```bash
# Full analysis
./scripts/day4-log-aggregation.sh full

# Individual operations
./scripts/day4-log-aggregation.sh aggregate
./scripts/day4-log-aggregation.sh analyze-errors
./scripts/day4-log-aggregation.sh trends
```

### 4. Configuration & Dashboard Templates

**Metrics Configuration (`monitoring/metrics-config.json`):**
- Collection intervals and retention policies
- Alert threshold definitions
- Export format configurations
- Maintenance automation settings

**Dashboard Template (`monitoring/dashboard-template.json`):**
- 10 comprehensive monitoring panels
- Grafana-compatible format
- Real-time metrics visualization
- Alert integration capabilities
