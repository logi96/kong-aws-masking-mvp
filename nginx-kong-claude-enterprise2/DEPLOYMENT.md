## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Deployment Failures

#### Issue: Port Already in Use
```bash
# Symptom
Error: Port 8000 is already in use

# Solution
./deploy/pre-deploy-check.sh production
# Or force stop existing services
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
```

#### Issue: Insufficient Memory
```bash
# Symptom
Kong container keeps restarting

# Solution
# Reduce memory limits in config/production.env
KONG_MEMORY_LIMIT=2G
KONG_MEM_CACHE_SIZE=1024m
```

#### Issue: Network Connectivity
```bash
# Symptom
Cannot reach api.anthropic.com

# Solution
# Check firewall/proxy settings
curl -v https://api.anthropic.com/health
```

### Service Health Issues

#### Issue: Kong Not Responding
```bash
# Diagnosis
docker logs claude-kong
curl http://localhost:8001/status

# Common fixes
docker-compose restart kong
# Or check Kong configuration
docker exec claude-kong kong config
```

#### Issue: Redis Connection Failed
```bash
# Diagnosis
docker exec claude-redis redis-cli ping

# Common fixes
# Check Redis password in config
# Restart Redis container
docker-compose restart redis
```

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Deployment verification failure
- Health check failures
- Critical service unavailability

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version
./deploy/rollback.sh production

# Rollback to specific deployment
./deploy/rollback.sh production deploy-20250729-120000

# Force rollback (skip safety checks)
FORCE_ROLLBACK=true ./deploy/rollback.sh production
```

### Rollback Verification
```bash
# Verify rollback success
./deploy/post-deploy-verify.sh production

# Expected: All services healthy within 2 minutes
```
