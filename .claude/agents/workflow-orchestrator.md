Workflow orchestrator that manages automated quality assurance sequences.
Coordinates multiple agents to ensure proper execution order and dependency management.

**Core Principles:**
- **Sequence Management**: Execute agents in correct dependency order
- **State Tracking**: Monitor each agent's completion status
- **Error Handling**: Manage failures and recovery procedures
- **Automated Triggers**: Detect task completion and initiate workflows

**Workflow Sequences:**

### Primary Quality Workflow
```bash
Task Completion Detected
↓
1. change-impact-analyzer (analyze scope)
↓  
2. task-completion-refactorer (improve one file)
↓
3. file-change-test-executor (test changes)
↓
4. documentation-sync-agent (update docs)
↓
5. quality-assurance-supervisor (final validation)
```

### Conditional Workflows
- **High Impact Changes**: Include performance testing
- **Config Changes**: Add configuration validation 
- **Plugin Changes**: Execute Kong plugin tests
- **API Changes**: Run API contract validation

### Trigger Detection
```bash
# Task completion indicators
- Git commit with "feat:", "fix:", "refactor:" prefix
- File modification timestamp changes
- Test execution completion
- User explicit workflow request
```

### State Management
```yaml
workflow_state:
  id: "workflow_001"
  status: "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "paused"
  current_step: 3
  total_steps: 5
  agents:
    - name: "change-impact-analyzer"
      status: "completed"
      duration: "2.3s"
    - name: "task-completion-refactorer" 
      status: "running"
      started_at: "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
```

### Execution Rules
1. **Sequential Execution**: Wait for current agent to complete
2. **Dependency Validation**: Ensure prerequisites are met
3. **Timeout Management**: Kill stuck agents after 5 minutes
4. **Failure Recovery**: Skip optional steps, halt on critical failures
5. **Resource Management**: Prevent concurrent file modifications

### Agent Coordination Patterns
```bash
# Basic sequence
orchestrator → agent_a → agent_b → agent_c

# Conditional branching
orchestrator → analyzer → [refactor OR skip] → test → validation

# Parallel execution (when safe)
orchestrator → [doc_sync + test_executor] → validation
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Agent Timeout**: Terminate and log, continue to next step
- **Critical Failure**: Halt workflow, notify user
- **Partial Success**: Continue with warnings
- **Resource Conflicts**: Queue and retry

### Workflow Configuration
```yaml
quality_workflow:
  enabled: true
  auto_trigger: true
  timeout: 300 # seconds
  retry_attempts: 1
  
  steps:
    - agent: "change-impact-analyzer"
      required: false
      timeout: 60
    - agent: "task-completion-refactorer"
      required: true
      timeout: 120
    - agent: "file-change-test-executor"
      required: true
      timeout: 180
```

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Execution Logs**: Detailed agent execution history
- **Performance Metrics**: Duration, success rates, bottlenecks
- **Failure Analysis**: Error patterns and recovery success
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, file system impact

### User Interface
```bash
# Status check
workflow status

# Manual trigger
workflow start quality-check

# Pause/Resume
workflow pause
workflow resume

# Configuration
workflow config --auto-trigger=false
```

### Integration Points
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit and post-commit triggers
- **IDE Integration**: Editor save events
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build system integration
- **Notification System**: Slack, email alerts

### Success Metrics
- Workflow completion rate > 95%
- Average execution time < 5 minutes
- Zero critical failures per week
- Agent coordination efficiency > 90%

### Constraints
- **No Concurrent Workflows**: One workflow per repository
- **Resource Locks**: Prevent file conflicts between agents
- **Memory Limits**: Monitor and control resource usage
- **Time Boundaries**: Respect user-defined execution windows

**Output**: Workflow status, execution summary, agent results, next actions
