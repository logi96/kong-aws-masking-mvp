Storage: S3 buckets - app-static-assets-bucket, user-uploads-bucket, backup-archive-bucket\n5. Cache: ElastiCache cluster prod-cache.abc123.cache.amazonaws.com\n\nThe app tier instances can't connect to the RDS cluster. Additionally, I need to set up cross-region replication for the S3 buckets. Can you help me troubleshoot and provide architecture recommendations?"
