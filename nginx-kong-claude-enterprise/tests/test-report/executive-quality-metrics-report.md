## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### P0 - Production Blockers (Fix within 30 days)
1. **Fail-Secure Mode Bypass** (TC-RD-001)
   - System continues operating when Redis fails
   - Security controls can be bypassed
   - **Risk**: Data exposure, compliance violations

2. **Container Restart Policy** 
   - Containers don't restart on failure
   - Manual intervention required
   - **Risk**: Extended downtime, SLA violations

3. **Secret Management**
   - API keys and passwords in plaintext
   - No encryption or vault integration
   - **Risk**: Security breach, credential theft

### P1 - High Priority (Fix within 60 days)
1. **Performance Issues**
   - 400ms average response time (4x target)
   - No caching or optimization
   - **Impact**: User experience, throughput

2. **Test Automation Gap**
   - No CI/CD pipeline
   - Manual test execution
   - **Impact**: Release velocity, quality
