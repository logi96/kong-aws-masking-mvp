# SDK Proxy Infrastructure Test Report

## Test Execution Summary
- **Date**: 2025-07-28 08:33 KST
- **Environment**: Docker Compose (sdk-proxy)
- **Agents Involved**: Infrastructure Engineer, Systems Architect, Reliability Monitor

## Infrastructure Setup Results

### 1. Docker Environment Deployment
- **Status**: ✅ Partially Successful
- **Components Started**:
  - ✅ nginx-proxy (Port 8888) - Running with health issues
  - ✅ kong-minimal (Port 8000/8001) - Running and healthy
  - ✅ sdk-tester - Executed tests successfully
- **Network**: sdk-test-net (172.30.0.0/16) created successfully

### 2. Component Connection Verification

#### Network Connectivity
- **nginx-proxy**: 172.30.0.3/16
- **kong-minimal**: 172.30.0.2/16
- **Network Isolation**: Confirmed (api.anthropic.com → 127.0.0.1)

#### Service Endpoints
| Service | Port | Status | Response |
|---------|------|--------|----------|
| Kong Proxy | 8000 | ✅ Running | 404 (expected) |
| Kong Admin | 8001 | ❌ Not Accessible | No response |
| Nginx Proxy | 8888 | ⚠️ Running | 502 Bad Gateway |

### 3. Health Check Results

#### Individual Service Health
- **Kong Gateway**: ✅ Healthy
  - Internal health check: "Kong is healthy at /usr/local/kong"
  - Workers: 12 workers ready and connected
  
- **Nginx Proxy**: ⚠️ Unhealthy
  - Health endpoint: Responding with "nginx proxy healthy"
  - Proxy function: Failing with 502 errors
  - Issue: Unable to connect to upstream (api.anthropic.com)

### 4. SDK Test Results

| Test Method | Result | Response Time | Error |
|-------------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Direct Connection | ✅ Blocked (Expected) | 1374ms | Connection error |
| ProxyAgent | ❌ Failed | 1251ms | Connection error |
| Environment Variable | ❌ Failed | 1453ms | 502 Bad Gateway |
| Custom Fetch | ❌ Failed | 1334ms | 502 Bad Gateway |

**Summary**: 1/4 tests passed (25% success rate)

## Issues Identified

### 1. Configuration Issues
- **Nginx SSL Verification**: Had to disable SSL verification due to missing certificates
- **Kong Admin API**: Port 8001 not accessible from host (possible binding issue)
- **Plugin Compatibility**: simple-logger plugin not available in Kong 3.9

### 2. Proxy Issues
- **Nginx → Claude API**: 502 Bad Gateway errors
- **Possible Causes**:
  - SSL/TLS handshake failures
  - DNS resolution issues in container
  - Missing authentication headers

### 3. Health Check Issues
- Initial nginx health checks failed due to request_id variable conflicts
- Health check endpoints need proper configuration

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Nginx SSL Configuration**:
   - Add proper CA certificates for SSL verification
   - Or use system CA bundle: `proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt;`

2. **Debug Kong Admin API Access**:
   - Check if port 8001 is properly exposed
   - Verify KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN configuration

3. **Fix Nginx Upstream Connection**:
   - Add proper DNS resolver: `resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4;`
   - Debug SSL handshake issues
   - Verify proxy headers are correctly set

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Add Prometheus metrics endpoint
   - Implement detailed request/response logging
   - Add distributed tracing

2. **Security Hardening**:
   - Re-enable SSL verification with proper certificates
   - Add rate limiting per client
   - Implement API key rotation

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add connection pooling
   - Implement caching layer
   - Optimize buffer sizes

## Conclusion

The infrastructure was successfully deployed with all containers running, but the proxy functionality is not working due to upstream connection issues. The main blocker is the nginx proxy's inability to establish a secure connection to api.anthropic.com. Once the SSL/TLS configuration is fixed, the proxy chain should function correctly.

**Overall Status**: ⚠️ **Partially Operational** - Infrastructure running but proxy functionality needs fixes
